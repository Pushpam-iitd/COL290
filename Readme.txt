1. click on the mode displayed on the welcome screen.
2. for 3D reconstruction:
	- we have to provide three views namely Top, Side, and Front.
	- For each view there are two files to be input: vertices file, and the edges file
	- vertices file contains the vertices of the 2D figure in that view, and no extra vertices.
	- edges file is the adjacency matrix.
	- Then input the rotation angles which are applied to the 3D.
	- Click on "convert".
	- Click on "Show now!".

3. For taking Projections:
  	- input the vertex and the edges file.
	- Click on convert.
	- On the next page you can see the three views:Top, Side, and Front.
